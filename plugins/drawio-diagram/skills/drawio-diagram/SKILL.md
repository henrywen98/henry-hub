# Draw.io Diagram Generator

Generates professional `.drawio` diagrams with Chinese text support, built-in visual verification, and automatic partitioning for complex flows.

## Input Modes

| Mode | When to Use | How Phase 1 Works |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Code Mode** | User has a codebase and wants to extract actual business logic | Launch Explore agents to analyze source code |
| **Document Mode** | User has PRD, requirements, specs, or an existing diagram file | Read the document(s) and extract structure |
| **Direct Mode** | User describes what to draw directly (e.g., "画一个XX架构图") | Skip Phase 1, go straight to Phase 2 |

Determine the mode from context. If unclear, ask.

## Workflow

## Phase 0: Complexity Assessment

Quickly scan the input to understand scale and plan the approach.

### Quick Scan

Read the first ~100 lines of the input (or skim the codebase structure). Identify:
- **Number of distinct modules/areas** (e.g., 8 modules = complex)
- **Estimated total elements** (states + rules + connections)
- **Cross-module dependencies** (few vs many)

### Decide Execution Strategy

| Complexity | Modules | Elements | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Simple** | 1-3 | < 30 | Single-threaded: read all → generate single page |
| **Medium** | 4-5 | 30-60 | Single-threaded extraction, but plan multi-page output |
| **Complex** | 6+ | 60+ | **Parallel agents** for both extraction AND generation |

### Agent Plan for Complex Inputs

For complex inputs (6+ modules, 60+ elements), plan the full agent topology before executing:

```
Phase 1 agents (parallel extraction):
  Agent A: modules 1-3 (e.g., 销售+采购+库存)
  Agent B: modules 4-6 (e.g., 发货+单证+收款)
  Agent C: modules 7-8 + cross-module automations + appendix sections

Phase 3 agents (parallel generation):
  Agent X: overview page + modules 1-3 detail pages
  Agent Y: modules 4-6 detail pages
  Agent Z: modules 7-8 detail pages + automation summary page
  → Merge all pages into single .drawio file
```

Write this plan down before spawning any agents. Specify:
1. Which agent handles which modules
2. What structured data each agent should return
3. How the outputs will be merged

---

## Phase 1: Extract Content

### Code Mode — Parallel Codebase Exploration

Launch **up to 3 Explore agents in parallel**, each with a focused scope. Extract every piece of business logic: state machines, status transitions, cross-module automations, approval flows.

**Agent split strategy** — adapt to the codebase's architecture:

| Architecture | Agent 1 | Agent 2 | Agent 3 |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| DDD/Layered | Core domains (orders, sales) | Supporting domains (inventory, shipping) | Cross-cutting (events, payments) |
| MVC | Controllers + routes | Models + validations | Background jobs + integrations |
| Microservices | Service A + B | Service C + D | Message queues + API contracts |
| Monolith | Feature group A | Feature group B | Shared logic + DB triggers |

**Each agent must extract:**
- All status/state values and their transition rules (from → to)
- Methods that change state (what triggers them, what happens)
- Events/messages — who publishes, who subscribes
- Business rules (validation thresholds, auto-triggers, approval conditions)
- Cross-module references (which module depends on which)

### Document Mode — Parallel Document Analysis

For **simple** documents (< 30 elements): read directly and extract inline.

For **complex** documents (6+ modules, 60+ elements): launch **up to 3 agents in parallel**, each responsible for a subset of modules.

**Each agent must return structured data:**
```
Module: 销售管理
  States: [草稿, 采购中, 已提货, 已入库, 发货中, 已完成]
  Transitions: 草稿→采购中(审批通过), 采购中→已提货(采购提货完成), ...
  Business Rules: [仅草稿可编辑删除, 收款上限=110%, ...]
  Automations In: [采购提货→已提货, 入库完成→已入库, ...]
  Automations Out: [审批通过→生成采购单, ...]
```

After all agents return, **merge** their outputs into a unified business model.

### Direct Mode

User describes the diagram directly. Skip to Phase 2 with the user's description as input.

---

## Phase 2: Structure & Partition Planning

### Build the Diagram Model

Organize into:

1. **Modules / Groups** — each business area or system component becomes a colored zone
2. **Nodes** — individual steps, states, services, or components
3. **Connections** — arrows showing flow, dependencies, or data movement
4. **Annotations** — notes, conditions, labels on connections

### Gap Analysis (Code/Document Mode only)

Compare what SHOULD be automated vs what IS:

| Pattern | How to Detect | Business Risk |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Orphaned events | Published but no subscriber | No downstream effect |
| Missing reverse | Create auto-triggers but delete/update doesn't | Data inconsistency |
| Manual bottleneck | Could auto-advance but requires manual action | Workflow stalls |
| Broken chain | A→B→C but C doesn't feed back to A | Incomplete end-to-end flow |
| Undefined transition | Document mentions states but no path between them | Ambiguous workflow |

### Partition Decision

| Metric | Single Page | Multi-Page |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Total nodes | ≤ 30 | > 30 |
| Distinct modules/groups | ≤ 5 | > 5 |
| Cross-module connections | ≤ 15 | > 15 |

**If multi-page**: split along business boundaries. Add a "全景总览" page as the first page.

**Panorama page rules (critical):**
- Module boxes must be **rich** — include title, subtitle, key state flow, key business rules. NOT empty boxes with just a title.
- Minimum box size: 250x150 for modules with 4+ lines of content
- Minimum gap between boxes: **100px** so arrows are visible and not covered by text
- Arrow labels between modules should be **short** (1-3 chars like "入库", "出库")
- Include a **visual legend** using actual line/shape elements (not text descriptions). See "Visual Legend Pattern" in drawio-spec.md.
- The panorama should tell the full business story — someone reading only this page should understand the system.

### Write the Blueprint

Before generating XML, produce a text blueprint:

```
Page 1: 全景总览 (if multi-page)
  Modules: [A], [B], [C] — high-level connections

Page 2: Module A — "销售管理"
  Nodes: 状态1 → 状态2 → 状态3
  Decisions: 审批? → 通过/驳回

Gaps found (if applicable):
  1. ...
```

---

## Phase 3: Generate .drawio File

### Reference Loading (IMPORTANT)

Before writing any XML, read these references:

1. **Always read**: `references/drawio-spec.md` — XML structure, colors, shapes, layout grid
2. **Always read**: `references/edge-routing.md` — 7 routing rules, obstacle avoidance, mental checklist
3. **During verification**: `references/validation-guide.md` — structured checking schema

### Parallel Generation for Multi-Page Diagrams

For complex diagrams with 6+ pages, split across parallel agents:

1. Read drawio-spec.md and edge-routing.md yourself first
2. Assign pages to agents — each generates 2-4 pages as `<diagram>` XML blocks
3. Include spec context in each agent prompt — spec rules, blueprint, color scheme, existing IDs
4. **ID prefix convention** — Agent X uses `x_`, Agent Y uses `y_`, Agent Z uses `z_`
5. Merge all `<diagram>` blocks into a single `<mxfile>` element

For simple diagrams (1-3 pages), generate sequentially.

### Key XML Rules

- draw.io files are XML: `<mxfile>` → `<diagram>` → `<mxGraphModel>` → `<root>` → `<mxCell>`
- Every page needs root cells: `<mxCell id="0"/>` and `<mxCell id="1" parent="0"/>`
- All `<mxCell>` elements must be **siblings** — never nest mxCell inside another mxCell
- **Cell ID 必须用数字**（如 `id="2"`, `id="3"`），不要用字符串 ID（如 `id="start"`, `id="process1"`）。字符串 ID 会导致 draw.io web 版出现 `d.setId is not a function` 错误，桌面版也可能异常。
- **pageHeight 要匹配内容高度** — 垂直流程图如果内容超过 900px，必须增大 `pageHeight`（如 1800）。内容超出 pageHeight 时桌面版 CLI 会 Export failed。
- **Never include XML comments** (`<!-- -->`). draw.io strips comments, which breaks structural references.
- Chinese text works natively — no special font configuration needed
- Use `html=1` and `&lt;br&gt;` for multi-line text in values
- **Animated connectors**: add `flowAnimation=1` to edge style for animated flow visualization

### Pre-Generation Mental Checklist

Before outputting XML, mentally verify (from edge-routing.md):

1. "Do any edges cross over shapes that aren't their source/target?" → add waypoints
2. "Do any two edges share the same path?" → adjust exit/entry points
3. "Are any connection points at corners (both X and Y are 0 or 1)?" → use edge centers
4. "Could I rearrange shapes to reduce crossings?" → revise layout

### Business Language Rules (Code Mode)

When generating diagrams from code analysis, all text must use business language:

| Code Term | Business Term |
|-----------|--------------|
| Function names (`pick_up()`, etc.) | Remove; use arrows + action words |
| Event names (`PaymentCreated`) | "录入收款后", "审批通过后" |
| Technical concepts (`EventBus`, `ACL`) | "系统自动联动" — never use "EventBus" even in annotations |
| Field references (`sales_order_id`) | "关联销售订单" |
| Domain jargon (`aggregate`, `handler`, `repository`) | Remove entirely |
| Implementation details (`异步执行`, `数据库提交后`) | Remove or rephrase as "自动触发" |

**Zero tolerance**: scan every `value` attribute before saving. If any text contains code terms like `EventBus`, `handler`, `aggregate`, `async`, `commit`, `session`, `query` — replace or remove them.

---

## Phase 4: Visual Verification

After generating the `.drawio` file, verify its visual quality.

### Export to PNG

Try methods in priority order:

**Method 1: Docker export-server (preferred — most reliable)**

`jgraph/export-server` 是 draw.io 官方导出服务，基于 Puppeteer + Chrome，无 Electron 渲染限制。

```bash
# 启动（首次会自动 pull 镜像）
docker run -d --rm --name drawio-export -p 8000:8000 jgraph/export-server

# 导出 PNG
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ \
  --data-urlencode "xml@<file>.drawio" \
  -d "format=png" -d "scale=2" -d "border=10" -d "bg=ffffff" \
  -o /tmp/diagram-verify.png

# 用完停掉
docker rm -f drawio-export
```
For multi-page: add `-d "pageId=<diagram-id>"` to select a specific page.

**Method 2: draw.io CLI (simple diagrams only)**

> ⚠️ draw.io desktop CLI (Electron) 对复杂图有渲染 bug：节点 14+ 且含分支 edge 路由时会静默 `Export failed`，macOS 上尤为严重。仅适用于简单图（<13 节点）。

```bash
"/Applications/Draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io" -x -f png --scale 2 -o /tmp/diagram-verify.png <file>.drawio
```
For multi-page: add `-p <page_index>` (0-based).

**Method 3: Playwright (fallback)**
Open `https://app.diagrams.net` headless, import file, screenshot.

**Method 4: Browser MCP (fallback)**
Use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools if available.

### Structured Inspection

Read the PNG with the `Read` tool. Check using the **severity-based schema** from validation-guide.md:

**Critical (must fix before delivery):**
1. **arrow-text-collision** — arrows crossing through node labels or group titles
2. **element-overlap** — shapes covering each other, content unreadable
3. **edge-routing** — arrows going through non-source/target nodes
4. **rendering** — incomplete, corrupted, or missing elements

**Warning (record but don't block delivery):**
5. **text-readability** — labels visible and not garbled
6. **layout-balance** — modules evenly spaced, no extreme crowding
7. **color-coding** — different modules/groups visually distinguishable
8. **completeness** — all expected modules, nodes, connections present

`valid = true` only if zero critical issues.

---

## Phase 5: Fix & Re-verify

If critical issues found:

1. Identify specific elements with problems (by name, not "some elements")
2. Edit the `.drawio` XML with the `Edit` tool — adjust coordinates, add waypoints, fix styles
3. Re-export to PNG and re-inspect
4. **Max 3 retries.** After that, deliver with remaining warnings noted.

Common fixes:
- Arrow crossing text → add waypoints or adjust exit/entry points (see edge-routing.md)
- Elements overlapping → shift coordinates, increase spacing
- Text truncated → increase element width/height
- Missing connections → add edge elements with correct source/target IDs

If no export method is available, do structural self-check:
- Verify element positions don't overlap (check x/y/width/height ranges)
- Verify all connections reference valid source/target cell IDs
- Verify all text content is present
- Inform user that visual verification was skipped

---

## Phase 6: Deliver

1. Save `.drawio` to the project root (or user-specified path)
2. Report:
   - File path and size
   - Number of pages (if multi-page), modules, and connections
   - Gaps identified (if Code/Document mode)
   - Verification result (visual pass/fail, iterations needed)
3. Explain how to open:
   - **draw.io desktop**: double-click the file
   - **VS Code**: install "Draw.io Integration" extension, then click the file
   - **Web**: open https://app.diagrams.net → File → Open
