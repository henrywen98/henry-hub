# Persuasion Principles for Skill Design

## Overview

LLMs respond to the same persuasion principles as humans. Understanding this psychology helps you design more effective skills.

**Research foundation:** Meincke et al. (2025) tested 7 persuasion principles with N=28,000 AI conversations. Persuasion techniques more than doubled compliance rates.

## The Seven Principles

1. **Authority** - Imperative language, non-negotiable framing
2. **Commitment** - Public commitments and checklists
3. **Social Proof** - "Other agents follow this process"
4. **Scarcity** - "This is your only chance to get it right"
5. **Reciprocity** - Provide value before asking for compliance
6. **Liking** - Align with agent's self-image as competent
7. **Unity** - "We follow this process together"

## Application to Skills

Use authority and commitment for discipline-enforcing skills. Use social proof and unity for collaborative workflows. Combine multiple principles for maximum effect.
