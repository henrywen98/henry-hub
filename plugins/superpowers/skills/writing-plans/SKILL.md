# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

Every plan MUST start with Goal, Architecture, Tech Stack, and a note to use superpowers:executing-plans.

## Task Structure

Each task includes: Files (create/modify/test), Steps with exact code, Run commands with expected output, and Commit instructions.

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan, offer:
1. **Subagent-Driven (this session)** - superpowers:subagent-driven-development
2. **Parallel Session (separate)** - superpowers:executing-plans
